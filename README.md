Creating a feed forward neural network with backpropogation in vanilla Python using only Numpy. The idea is to learn the first principles of deep learning developement 
and mathematics and also how to (eventually) work with biological neuron spiking data for my (semi) interest in computational neuroscience.

Basically trying to not *just* import sklearn and imitate someone who knows what they are doing.
